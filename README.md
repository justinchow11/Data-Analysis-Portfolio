### This repository contains a series of notebooks showcasing data analysis projects.

- [Using data to win Jeopardy](https://github.com/justinchow11/Data-Analysis-Portfolio/blob/master/src/jeopardy.ipynb) (Incomplete - Last updated 9/25/17)
  - This project explores ways to gain an edge in the gameshow "Jeopardy". I analyze whether hints to answers are found in the questions themselves, and how often past questions are repeated.

- [Pokemon Challenge](https://github.com/justinchow11/Data-Analysis-Portfolio/blob/master/src/pokemon/pokemon.ipynb) (Incomplete - Last updated 9/30/17)
  - This project attempts to predict the winner of pokemon battles!. I analyze which stats make a pokemon victorious, and apply my findings to a series of test battles.
  - Still to do:
    - Further investigate the effects of other stats
    - Predict winners in the test battles csv
